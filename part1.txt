STEPS ON CREATING EC2 ON AWS 


1.SEARCH FOR EC2
2.look for LUNCH INSTANCE ====>>GIVVE IT A NAME lecture_instance
3.SELECT  normamlly t2 micro free tier
4.AMAZON LINUX 2023 KERNEL-6.1 AMI
7.64-bit(x86) choice
8.create a key pair: call it ===>lecture_key
   RSA
    .pem
take t3 micro since is still elegible 
9.  1. allow ssh traffic from 
    2.my IP 
    3.allow http traffic from the internet. (leave the rest blank)


10.lunch!!! only one.     


we dont want to commit our lecture_key to our repo

11. got to INSTANCE: youll see the instance specifications



.ssh/lecture_rsa


12.copy and paste public ipv4 address.
#click on the link instance everything is here.

13. mv .ssh/lecture_key.pem vs_code/aws/people_getter2/frontend. all of it mac terminal.


14.ALL THIS IN MAC TERMINAL.
all this is inn connect from instance:
A.Run this command, if necessary, to ensure your key is not publicly viewable.
chmod 400 "lecture_key.pem"

B.Connect to your instance using its Public DNS:
ssh -i "lecture_key.pem" ec2-user@ec2-18-220-220-243.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com#replacing your .pem file and ip as appropriate.

c.answer yes!!!
d. with this youve create you ec2 on your terminal.
e.cd .ssh and cd to go back.
f. in this terminal: ~/
sudo yum install -y git && \
sudo yum install docker -y && \
sudo service docker start && \
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER  && \
# sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose && \
# sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose && \
newgrp docker





15.MAC TERMINAL:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "myname@gmail.com"

16.copy the lecture_rsa.pub into git hub generating a key.


17.scp -i "<KEYNAME>.pem" id_rsa id_rsa.pub ec2-user@ec2-44-199-230-104.compute-1.amazonaws.com:~/.ssh/

    
#######
EC2 terminal 
18.eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
#expected resposne ==>>> Agent pid 31175
19.ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
20.GIT CLONE SSH CODE FROM GIT HUB as SSH



DO THIS ON YOUR MAC IN YOUR TERMINAL: everything has to be in 
~/ssh folder # you could find it by using #ls -lart 

ssh is hidden home. 

lecture_rsa private this is the one you gonna do cat and paste from mac terminal to ec2 terminal. make sure you are in .ssh to da that
lecture_rsa.pub public this is the one im copying in github SSH KEYS. as new  add a tittle.copy that key and add it in github
description is very important for best practices.


#########.ssh -keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "myname@gmail". dont mind the gmail

#put the new api by ec2 in javascript very important


key.pem will let me get in to the instance. thats whats for.he
actually placed this in front_end.

chmod 400"<lecture_key.pem>" =====> remember to put it in the front-end very important in the terminal. make sure access is open to read  user-group-all 4-0-0 read-blank -blank.

to read the key is ===>> vi lecture_rsa 



###########################################

run this on mac terminal:MAC TERMINAL
make sure you have in your ~/.ssh     lecture_key.pom   -lecture_rsa.pub  -   lecture_rsa





CHECK THAT IN BOTH COMPUTERS. MAC AND EC2.
UNDER .SSH

MAC TEMINAL:

#cd .shh if need to evrything here is under .ssh 

1.have this 3 lecture_key.pom   -lecture_rsa.pub  -   lecture_rsa
.ssh always here then:

2.scp -i "<KEYNAME>.pem" id_rsa id_rsa.pub ec2-user#.......compute-1.amazonans.com:~/.SSH ...........  rember to put the right connect to your instance usiing its public DNS:   under connect-ssh client --number 4th. that has to be it.JUST COMPLETE THAT PART BY PASTING IT.
3. before moving make sure they are there


EC2:
4.run this on your ec2=====>>>  eval "$(ssh-agent -S)". run it you should be able to see Agent pid 29120 in this case.. check this 

5.ssh-ass ~/.ssh/lecture_rsa

6. get out of .shh 
7.cd make suere you ~/ home.
8.git clone repository given as people_getter2  as ssh and ls to check.
9.cd people_getter2 
10. .start_up and run 
11. docker ps to check docker. entry and out ports check thi sin EC2








12.when open in instance open address make sure https://ip>address go http public version
